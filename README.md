# Arithmetic-logic-unit
-  Implementation of ALU unit in microprocessor and other digital circuits using VHDL.
-  Designs requirements are
   -  8-bit adder/subtractor based on ripple carry adder.
   -  16-bit carry look-ahead adder with minimum gate delay that adds A0-15 to B0-15 then produces S0-15 and C16 using structural modelling.
   -  8-bit array(regular) multiplication.
   -  8-bit sequential multiplication.
   -  radix-2 Boothâ€™s multiplier for multiplying 8-bit operands.
   -  non-restoring division circuit.
   -  8-bit ALU with inputs (A , B) and Z as output which is capable of carrying out 8 operation(ADD,SUB,MULT,DIV,OR,AND,Not,XOR).
-  You can find circuits designs in Circuit-Designs directory.
